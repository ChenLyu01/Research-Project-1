## Welcome to my Research Project One

First, I want to introduce the game engine to you, yes, a very famous game engine: Phaser.

Let me tell you about its URL first [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). If you are interested in it, please read the instructions in the website.

I'm not here to popularize a game engine, or to advertise it. In fact, I want to make one [Navigable Video](http://www.06-90.com/final/finalprojectChenLyu.html). That's the purpose of my study.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ChenLyu01/Research-Project-1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
